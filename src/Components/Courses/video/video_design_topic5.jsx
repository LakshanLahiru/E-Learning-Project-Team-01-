        are two terms that are often used interchangeably. 
        In essence, while video designing involves the overall
         conception and creation of video content, video editing 
         is a crucial step in refining and enhancing that content
          during the post-production phase. Both contribute uniquely 
          to the final video, with designing setting the initial
           vision and editing bringing that vision to its polished 
           fruition
